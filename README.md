# Random Waypoint Mobility (RWP) Simulation

A mobile data management project implementing Random Waypoint Mobility model for network simulation.

## Project Overview

This project simulates 25 mobile nodes in a 1000x1000m network using the Random Waypoint Mobility model. Each node randomly selects destinations, moves at specified speeds, and pauses for configurable durations.
