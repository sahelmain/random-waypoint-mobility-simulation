# Source Code

This directory will contain the C source code for the Random Waypoint Mobility simulation.

## Files

- `proj3_azzam_sahel.c` - Main simulation implementation (coming soon)
- `utils.h` - Utility functions and data structures (coming soon)
- `mobility.h` - Mobility model definitions (coming soon)

## Compilation

The main source file should be compiled using CSIM's GCC wrapper:

```bash
./csim.gcc proj3_azzam_sahel.c -o proj3_azzam_sahel
```

## File Naming Convention

Following the project requirements, the main source file is named:
`proj3_azzam_sahel.c` (project number + last name + first name)
