Summer II 2025 
 
Project #3: Mobile Users – Random Waypoint Mobility (RWP) 
 
• Name only: ____________________________________ 
• Release date: July 24, 2025 (Thursday) 
• Due date: August 6, 2025 (Wednesday), submit through Raider Canvas before midnight, 
11:59 PM  
• It should be done individually; No handwritten code or report; No email submission; No late project 
will be accepted.  
• Total 20 points 
  
1.  Implement  mobile  users  following  a  simple  random  waypoint  mobility  (RWP)  model.  There  is  a 
network where 25 nodes are uniformly distributed. Each node randomly selects a destination location and 
moves toward it at a given speed. Upon arrival, each node stays at the destination for a pausing time. 
Then select another random destination and move toward it. Repeat the same procedure. Refer to the 
following simulation parameters. Run your program at least four times by changing parameters (speed, 
pause time), e.g., (1, 0), (1, 50), (2, 0), and (2, 50).    
 
Parameter  Value 
Number of nodes  25 
Network size  1,000 x 1,000 m2 
Mobility  Random Waypoint  
Speed  1 or 2 m/sec 
Pause time  0 or 50 secs 
 
     For  each  end  of  simulation  run,  draw/produce  the  following  graphs/results  and  compare  them  for 
analysis.    
• [Graph] An initial network topology 
• [Graph] Snapshots of the network topologies after the simulation times, 2,000 and 4,000.  
• Average moving distance (total amount of moving distances / number of nodes) 
 
2. Type the project number and your name (Last, First) at the top of your source code. 
• /* Project #3; Bond, James */ 
 
3. Refer to CSIM manual uploaded in the class homepage:   
• CSIM20 Quick Start Guide for C 
• CSIM20 User's Guide for C  
• http://www.mesquite.com/documentation/ 
 
4. Compilation & Run:  
• ./csim.gcc proj3_bond_james.c –o proj3_bond_james 
• ./proj3_bond_james 
 
5. What to submit?   
• Source code(s)  
o Your  source  code  name  should  be  “project  number”  +  “last  name”  +  “first  name”,  e.g., 
“pro3_bond_james.c”. 
• Report (e.g., pdf) including,  
o Your  report  file  name  should  be  “project  number”  +  “last  name”  +  “first  name”,  e.g., 
“pro3_bond_james.pdf”. 
o Instructions on how to run your program 
o All the simulation parameters or assumption(s) deployed 
o One  initial  network  topology  graph,  eight  snapshot  graphs  (two/run),  average  moving 
distance, and analysis/explanation 
o Any implementation issues or anything you want to mention  
• The TA will compile and run your source code(s) for validity.
